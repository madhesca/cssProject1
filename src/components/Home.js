        <h1>Michael Jordan</h1>
        <p>
          Jordan played three seasons for coach Dean Smith with the North
          Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels'
          national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as
          the third overall draft pick, and quickly emerged as a league star,
          entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a
          reputation as one of the game's best defensive players.[7] His leaping
          ability, demonstrated by slam dunks from the free throw line in Slam
          Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames "Air Jordan" and "His
          Airness". Jordan won his first NBA championship with the Bulls in
          1991, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993,
          securing a "three-peat". Jordan abruptly retired from basketball
          before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball, but
          returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more
          championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72
          regular-season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season. He retired for a second
          time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001
          to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards.

        <h1>Kobe Bryant</h1>
        <p>
          Kobe Bean Bryant (/ˈkoʊbiː/ KOH-bee; August 23, 1978 – January 26,
          2020) was an American professional basketball player for the Los
          Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA). As a
          shooting guard, he entered the league directly from high school, and
          played his entire 20-season professional career with the Lakers.
          Bryant won many accolades: five NBA championships, 18-time All-Star,
          15-time member of the All-NBA Team, 12-time member of the
          All-Defensive Team, 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), two-time NBA
          Finals MVP winner. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of
          all time,[3][4][5][6] he led the NBA in scoring during two seasons,
          ranks fourth on the league's all-time regular season scoring and
          all-time postseason scoring lists.

        <h1>Jobe and Michael</h1>
        <p>
          FOR YEARS, MICHAEL JORDAN and Kobe Bryant had been protective of their
          relationship. Jordan would call Bryant his "little brother," Bryant
          would call Jordan his "big brother," and they'd praise each other's
          work ethic and accomplishments. But rarely would either volunteer much
          more, each man knowing all too well that any glimpse would invite the
          kind of comparisons and debate they loathed. Only a few people had a
          sense of just how close Jordan and Bryant had become. "If you just
          watched them interact in a game, Kobe always was like a magnet going
          toward Michael," said former Los Angeles Lakers general manager Jerry
          West. "Usually Michael didn't really interact with a lot of players
          when he was on the court. He'd just play. But for some reason, he had
          this affinity for him."
