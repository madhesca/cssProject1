        <h1>Dwayne Wade</h1>
        <p>
          Dwyane Tyrone Wade Jr. (/dweɪn/ dwayn;[1] born January 17, 1982) is an
          American former professional basketball player. Wade spent the
          majority of his 16-year career playing for the Miami Heat in the
          National Basketball Association (NBA). After a successful college
          basketball career with the Marquette Golden Eagles, Wade was drafted
          fifth overall in the 2003 NBA draft by the Heat. In his third season,
          Wade led the Heat to their first NBA Championship in franchise history
          and was named the 2006 NBA Finals MVP. At the 2008 Summer Olympics,
          Wade led the United States men's basketball team, commonly known as
          the "Redeem Team", in scoring and helped them capture the gold medal.
          In the 2008–09 season, Wade led the league in scoring and earned his
          first NBA scoring title. With LeBron James and Chris Bosh, Wade helped
          guide Miami to four consecutive NBA Finals from 2011 to 2014, winning
          back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013. After playing for the
          Chicago Bulls and the Cleveland Cavaliers, Wade finished his playing
          career with Miami in 2019. A 13-time NBA All-Star, Wade is Miami's
          all-time leader in points, games, assists, steals, shots made, and
          shots taken.[2] Wade was born the second of two children to JoLinda
          and Dwayne Wade Sr. in Chicago, Illinois, on January 17, 1982. A
          spelling mistake on his birth certificate listed his first name as
          "Dwyane", which his parents kept.[3] JoLinda already had two children
          when she married Wade's father, and with him she had Dwyane and his
          older sister Tragil. The pair separated when Wade was four months old.
          Wade described his early childhood in the South Side of Chicago as
          trying.[4] When his parents divorced, JoLinda was given custody of the
          two children. JoLinda struggled with drug addiction, and she was in
          and out of prison. At eight years old, Tragil tricked her brother into
          thinking they were going to the movies, only to leave him to live with
          his father and stepmother. Wade visited his mother on occasion until
          his father moved the family to Robbins, Illinois, after which Wade
          would not see her for two years.[5] Wade turned to basketball and
          football, avoiding the temptations of drugs and gangs. Wade credited
          Tragil as the person most responsible for pointing him in the right
          direction.[6] Wade grew up idolizing Michael Jordan and modeled his
          game after him.[7] On October 14, 2001, as Wade's basketball career
          blossomed, JoLinda vowed to turn her life around. She says that she
          has not used drugs since 2003.[8]
