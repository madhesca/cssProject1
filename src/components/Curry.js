        <h1>Stephen Curry</h1>
        <p>
          Wardell Stephen "Steph" Curry II (/ˈstɛfən/ STEF-ən; born March 14,
          1988[1]) is an American professional basketball player for the Golden
          State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). A
          six-time NBA All-Star, Curry has been named the NBA Most Valuable
          Player (MVP) twice and won three NBA championships with the Warriors.
          Many players and analysts have called him the greatest shooter in NBA
          history.[2] He is credited with revolutionizing the game of basketball
          by inspiring teams to regularly utilize the three-point shot.[3][4][5]
          The son of former NBA player Dell Curry and older brother of current
          NBA player Seth, Curry played college basketball for the Davidson
          Wildcats. There, he was twice named Southern Conference Player of the
          Year and set the all-time scoring record for both Davidson and the
          Southern Conference. During his sophomore year, Curry also set the
          single-season NCAA record for three-pointers made, and was then
          selected by the Warriors with the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA
          Draft. In 2014–15, Curry won his first MVP award and led the Warriors
          to their first championship since 1975. The following season, he
          became the first player in NBA history to be elected MVP by a
          unanimous vote and to lead the league in scoring while shooting above
          50–40–90. That same year, the Warriors broke the record for the most
          wins in an NBA season en route to reaching the 2016 NBA Finals, which
          they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Curry helped the Warriors return
          to the NBA Finals in 2017, 2018 and 2019, winning back-to-back titles
          in 2017 and 2018, before being defeated by the Toronto Raptors in
          2019. During the 2012–13 season, Curry set the NBA record for
          three-pointers made in a regular season, with 272. He surpassed that
          record in 2015 with 286, and again in 2016 with 402. Curry is
          currently third in all-time made three-pointers in NBA history, and
          alongside teammate Klay Thompson, the pair have earned the nickname of
          the Splash Brothers; in 2013–14, they set the record for combined
          three-pointers in an NBA season with 484, a record they broke the
          following season (525), and again in the 2015–16 season (678).
