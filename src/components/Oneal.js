          LeBron Raymone James Sr. (/ləˈbrɒn/; born December 30, 1984) is an
          American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of
          the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is widely considered to
          be one of the greatest basketball players in NBA history. Discussions
          ranking him as the greatest basketball player of all time have often
          been subject to significant debate, with frequent comparisons to
          Michael Jordan.[1] James's teams have played in eight consecutive NBA
          Finals (2011–2018 seasons) between the Miami Heat and Cleveland
          Cavaliers. His accomplishments include three NBA championships, four
          NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, three Finals MVP Awards, and
          two Olympic gold medals. James holds the all-time record for playoffs
          points, is third in all-time points, and eighth in all-time assists.
          James was selected to the All-NBA First Team twelve times (all-time
          record), made the All-Defensive First Team five times, and has played
          in sixteen All-Star Games, in which he was selected All-Star MVP three
          times. James played basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in
          his hometown of Akron, Ohio, where he was heavily touted by the
          national media as a future NBA superstar. A prep-to-pro, he joined
          Cleveland in 2003 as the first overall draft pick. Named the 2003–04
          NBA Rookie of the Year, he soon established himself as one of the
          league's premier players, winning the NBA MVP Award in 2009 and 2010.
          After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010
          to sign as a free agent with Miami. This move was announced in an ESPN
          special titled The Decision, and is one of the most controversial free
          agent decisions in American sports history. James won his first two
          NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both
          of these years, he also earned league MVP and Finals MVP. After his
          fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract
          to re-sign with the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to
          victory over the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals by coming
          back from a 3–1 deficit, delivering the franchise's first championship
          and ending Cleveland's 52-year professional sports title drought. In
          2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers to sign with
          the Lakers. Off the court, James has accumulated additional wealth and
          fame from numerous endorsement contracts. His public life has been the
          subject of much scrutiny, and he has been ranked as one of America's
          most influential and popular athletes. He has been featured in books,
          documentaries, and television commercials. He has also hosted the ESPY
          Awards and Saturday Night Live, and appeared in the 2015 film
          Trainwreck. The LeBron James Family Foundation charity builds upon his
          vision to improve education for students in Akron, Ohio.
